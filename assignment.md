## Assignment

### Brief

Write your answers for each scenario:

Scenario 1:
Imagine you are hired by a startup company for a school to implement their IT infrastructure as their IT consultant. In your own words (300 words or less), describe how could implementing Scrum help their IT team improve their productivity.

```
Implementing Scrum in the school's IT infrastructure project can boost production by encouraging collaboration, flexibility, and transparency. With its agile methodology, Scrum divides the project into smaller, more manageable tasks known as sprints, which usually span two to four weeks. By taking this method, the IT team can concentrate on providing discrete, functional project components rather than attempting to finish everything at once.

Here are the key benefits,

1. Iterative Progress: By focussing on small, incremental targets, the IT team is able to consistently produce value. This enables for faster issue detection and response, keeping the project on track and adaptive to changes.

2. Enhanced Collaboration: Scrum emphasises daily stand-ups and sprint reviews to keep the entire team on track. This ongoing communication helps to avoid misunderstandings and ensures that everyone is working towards the same goals.

3. Flexibility: Scrum's iterative structure enables the team to respond swiftly to changes, whether they are caused by new needs, technological developments, or unexpected challenges. This is especially important in a dynamic environment like a startup, where priorities can move quickly.

4. Transparency and Accountability: Scrum supports a culture of transparency in which task progress is apparent to all. This visibility promotes accountability within the team because each member is aware of their obligations and how their work contributes to the larger project.

5. Continuous Improvement: Scrum teams do regular retrospectives in which they reflect on what went well and what may be improved. This focus on continual development allows the team to evolve their procedures, resulting in enhanced efficiency and production over time.

The implementation of Scrum allows the school's IT staff to work more efficiently, generating high-quality outcomes faster and adjusting to the project's and organization's changing needs.

Scenario 2:
Write ten (10) user stories for a book-borrowing website for a library. Write it in the format: `As a ____, I want to ____, so that _____`.

```
Here are 10 user stories for a book-borrowing website for a library:

As a library member, I want to search for books by title or author, so that I can easily find books I’m interested in.
As a library member, I want to view the availability of a book, so that I can know if it’s available for borrowing.
As a library member, I want to reserve a book that is currently checked out, so that I can borrow it when it becomes available.
As a library member, I want to see a list of all the books I have borrowed, so that I can keep track of what I need to return.
As a library member, I want to renew my borrowed books online, so that I can extend the borrowing period without visiting the library.
As a library member, I want to receive notifications when a reserved book is available for pickup, so that I can collect it promptly.
As a library member, I want to submit a request for a book that is not in the library's collection, so that the library can consider acquiring it.
As a librarian, I want to manage the inventory of books, so that I can update the system with new acquisitions or removed books.
As a librarian, I want to manage user accounts, so that I can assist members with issues like lost passwords or account updates.
As a librarian, I want to generate reports on book borrowings and returns, so that I can analyze library usage and trends.
